# COMP-472 Project
This repository contains the implementation of 4 machine learning models: Naive Bayes, decision tree, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and convolutional neural network (CNN).

All students are in section NN.

## Instructions
All of the implementation is in the `Code/COMP_472_Project.ipynb` file.
Normally, you need to install Jupyter to run this file, but we worked on a Google Colab notebook, which avoids installation complications.

1. Download the `COMP_472_Project.ipynb` file.
2. Go to the [Google Colab welcome page](https://colab.research.google.com/). Within the widget, select the **Upload** tab.
3. Select the **Browse** button and search for the downloaded jupyter file.
    > Note: you can also drag and drop the file into the widget.
4. When your new Colab notebook is loaded, click on the **Run All** button at the top left of the window.

Google Colab will run the `COMP_472_Project.ipynb` file, which includes setting up the dataset, training and testing the models.
Running the file will save the models in the `content` folder, which can be found in the **Files** tab in the left vertical navbar.
All models can be found in this repository in the `Models` folder.

## Layout of `COMP_472_Project.ipynb`
The file will be organized into different sections that correspond to the sections defined in the project outline (`Project___COMP472___Fall_2024F.pdf`):
